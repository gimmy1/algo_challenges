# Write a function, SumMaxK, that receives the parameters:
# Array of integers, where all the numbers within the array are between 0-9 (inclusive)
# Int K, where K > 0 and K <= len(ar)

# Function should calculate the maximum sum that you can construct by using K numbers from the array ar

# Best possible solution in time and space complexity

# Example:
# ar = [3,5,3,2,7,6,4,9,1,8,2,1,0,2]
# K = 3
# Function will return (7+9+8) = 2
